It’s time to give Entity Framework Core (EF Core) another look. This session will show you how EF Core has evolved and why it’s now an even more powerful and flexible tool for modern application development. Whether you’re building cloud-native apps, microservices, or just looking for a faster and more efficient way to interact with databases, EF Core has significantly improved in performance, scalability, and ease of use. We’ll dive into the latest features, optimizations, and best practices that make EF Core an indispensable tool for developers in today’s fast-paced world. From raw performance gains to advanced querying capabilities, to the flexibility of working with various databases (SQL Server, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and more), EF Core has become a highly capable, cross-platform solution for all your data access needs. In this session, we’ll explore the latest EF Core performance enhancements, how they can supercharge your apps, and how to leverage new features like improved raw SQL support, better LINQ performance, and advanced migrations. We'll also talk tips and tricks for making the most of EF Core in your projects, including best practices for working with complex models and optimizing queries. If you’ve written off EF Core in the past, this session will change your mind. Come see why it’s time to give EF Core a second chance and why it might just be the perfect fit for your next project!",

Everyone is welcome from Python beginners to experts. Bringing a laptop is encouraged (we'll have extension cords and power strips). If there's something you want to learn leave a comment on this invite so we can plan ahead.\n\nNew location starting Feb 6, Nocterra Brewery. 516 Maier Pl. This is near the end of Whittier in Audoban Park. The bridge into the park is one lane so you may have to wait a minute or two. We should be upstairs at a table..\n\nWe're looking for new locations for our dojos. The Little Grand [where we have been meeting] is centrally located, but tends to be noisy. If you have suggestions for a new location please add it to the comments below.\n\nWe're looking for topic suggestions and people interested in presenting at our monthly meetings.

            "description": "Greetings everyone. We have an open virtual meetup monthly on the second Thursday of each month. This is a companion event to our in-person meetups.\n\nWe update this event around 6:15 or so to include the meeting details.\n\nBring questions - if you are a new developer scratching your head or a business owner trying to decipher something that just doesn't quite make sense, bring your questions about Wordpress here and we'll do our best to answer them.\n\nDo you have a new plugin or snippet you've been working on? Looking for feedback on a project you've been toiling over or just want to get a third parties opinion on something? Let us know and we'll update the event with some details to help guide attendees. We love speakers, drop by for an informal chat or ask and we can block off some time for a formal presentation.\n\n***NOTE:*** *Our Meetup group usually discusses WordPress(.org)-related topics. (NOT [WordPress.com](http://WordPress.com) generally - if you aren't sure, you are still welcome to join!)*\n\n*If you'd like to speak or present at one of our meetings, please contact an Organizer with a topic and potential time when you could do it. (A description for sharing with our members would also help). We always welcome sharing experiences so others can learn. Thanks!*",

In this session, David Viejo from KFS will showcase how ChainLaunch empowers you to connect these nodes and even build robust networks across different blockchain platforms. If you’ve ever struggled with creating interoperable blockchain environments—or you’re simply curious about the future of multi-network solutions—this session is for you.\n\nChainLaunch provides an intuitive interface and behind-the-scenes automation, freeing developers from manually managing configuration files, certificates, and node setups. By leveraging modern deployment strategies—including container orchestration and proven security practices—ChainLaunch ensures that creating and scaling your blockchain networks is a frictionless experience. Whether you’re running a proof-of-concept or an enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure, ChainLaunch has the flexibility to fit your needs.\n\nThroughout this online meetup, you’ll learn how to set up ChainLaunch, explore its configuration options, and discover ways to integrate it with existing workflows. David will also discuss real-world scenarios for deploying consortia networks, illustrating how easy it is to spin up and connect Fabric and Besu environments in the same ecosystem. Join us to learn why ChainLaunch is poised to become the go-to solution for developers and organizations looking to embrace multi-platform blockchain deployments.\n\nFor more information on ChainLaunch, visit:\n• [https://kfsoft.tech/](https://kfsoft.tech/)\n• [https://chainlaunch.dev/](https://chainlaunch.dev/)",

During his pause he became a father, published a book (Kubeflow for Machine Learning: From Lab to Production), had a second son, consulted for a while, went back to work for IBM Research, and became car free (this list is not ordered chronologically nor by significance). He has been putzing around generative AI since \\~2017, and someday hopes to give a talk on his Star Trek Chat bots of 2018-2020. His primary open source interest at the moment is the **qumat** project of Apache Mahout and the **gofannon** project of the AI Alliance.\n\n**About the AI Alliance**\nThe [AI Alliance](https://thealliance.ai/) is an international community of researchers, developers and organizational leaders committed to support and enhance open innovation across the AI technology landscape to accelerate progress, improve safety, security and trust in AI, and maximize benefits to people and society everywhere. Members of the AI Alliance believe that open innovation is essential to develop and achieve safe and responsible AI that benefit society rather than benefit a select few big players.",
